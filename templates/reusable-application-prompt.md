# Reusable New Application Prompt

Use this prompt when starting a new chat where the goal is to create a tailored resume and cover letter for one specific job description.

I am starting a new application-package pipeline in this repo.

First, read AGENTS.md completely and follow the Application Package Generation pipeline only. Do not run the Job Discovery pipeline unless I explicitly ask for job searching.

I will provide one specific job description below. Treat that as approval to run the full application-package workflow:

1. Create or update application-packages/<Company>/<Role>/.
2. Save the posting as job-description.md.
3. Review profile/, master-documents/, templates/, and AGENTS.md before writing.
4. Build a keyword/alignment map from the job description.
5. Choose one primary role lane, including software engineering/full stack, data engineering, applied AI/agentic systems, data analyst/business analyst, product/operations analyst, security/IT/support-adjacent technical roles, or another adjacent early-career technical lane.
6. Run the internal F-1 Work Authorization Gate. If the posting is silent or ambiguous about sponsorship, proceed and track follow-up internally. If it explicitly says no visa/work-visa sponsorship, no current/future sponsorship, independent permanent work authorization, authorization to work for any employer, U.S. citizen/permanent resident only, incompatible clearance, or another direct conflict, pause/archive unless I explicitly ask to continue.
7. Do not mention F-1, OPT, STEM OPT, visa status, future sponsorship, E-Verify, or Form I-983 in the resume or cover letter unless I explicitly ask.
8. Create tailoring-notes.md with the resume strategy, role lane, cover-letter angle, referral plan, keyword targets, risks/gaps, bullet audit, ATS source gate, visual consistency gate, page utilization gate, and internal alignment notes.
9. Generate a tailored one-page resume.tex and resume.pdf.
10. Generate a concise, personal, role-aligned cover-letter.md and a submission-ready cover-letter.pdf or cover-letter.docx.
11. Keep every resume and cover-letter claim grounded in the repo source materials. Do not invent metrics, tools, employers, or experience.
12. Audit every experience and project bullet before compiling. Each bullet must show Aryan's individual contribution, the specific system/problem/project, the method or technology when relevant, scope/context, and impact/result.
13. Do not use projects as tech-stack dumps. Project bullets must explain the project's purpose, user/problem or technical challenge, implementation method, working result, and when useful, deployment/runnable setup, tests/validation, logging/observability, evaluation/source-grounding, dashboard/reporting output, or user/business impact.
14. Show broad skills through evidence instead of labels. Do not merely claim teamwork, communication, problem-solving, adaptability, ownership, leadership, or learning ability.
15. Use only interview-defensible bullets. Aryan should be able to explain the technical decisions, tradeoffs, tools used, personal contribution, result, and what he would improve.
16. Manually edit AI-assisted bullets until they are specific, grounded, and defensible. Reject polished but vague, inflated, buzzword-heavy, or unsupported bullets.
17. Keep gap/confession language out of the submitted cover letter unless it is strategically necessary; document unsupported keywords and missing requirements in tailoring-notes.md instead.
18. Make the resume exactly one full readable page, with no obvious blank band at the bottom and no cramped unreadable sections.
19. Preserve all internship roles by default; experience takes precedence over projects if space is tight.
20. Run the resume-vs-job-description alignment pass and record `Job Alignment & Evidence Score: X/100` in tailoring-notes.md with the internal-estimate disclaimer.
21. Record explicit `Pass` values for the ATS source gate, visual consistency gate, page utilization gate, and cover-letter artifact gate in tailoring-notes.md; use `Waived - <reason>` only for page utilization when no additional verified role-aligned evidence should be added.
22. Run python3 automation/validate_application_package.py application-packages/<Company>/<Role> and fix failures.
23. Clean generated LaTeX artifacts.
24. Make a small coherent commit and push to main.
25. In the final response, include artifact paths, one-page PDF verification, validator result, Job Alignment & Evidence Score, referral status, and commit hash.

## Short Version

```text
I am applying to the role below. Read AGENTS.md first and run only the Application Package Generation pipeline. Create the application package, choose the right role lane, tailor the one-page resume and cover letter, generate PDFs, run validation and the internal resume-vs-job-description alignment pass, add referral tracking, update the tracker, commit, and push. If sponsorship is silent or ambiguous, proceed and keep work-authorization follow-up internal; do not mention F-1/OPT/STEM OPT/visa status/sponsorship in submitted artifacts unless I explicitly ask. Keep all claims grounded in profile/ and master-documents/. Audit every experience and project bullet for individual contribution, specific system/problem, method/technology when relevant, scope/context, impact/result, and interview defensibility.
