## Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation

Role: Software Engineering Intern  
Location: Toledo, OH  
Dates: May 2022 - Aug. 2022

### Platform-Ready Description

Improved an AWS-hosted Lucee/CFML healthcare workflow platform for kidney-paired donation operations by strengthening form security, auditability, data-entry reliability, and internal clinical workflow usability. Work included global anti-CSRF form protection, IP-aware audit logging, protected access-denied/404 routing, HTML5 date/time picker modernization, JavaScript fallbacks, themed CSS, cfform/cfinput compatibility updates, reusable modal/tab UI patterns, clinical logistics defaults, Matchgrid import ordering, MFI file-location fixes, and duplicate-antigen MFI crash handling. The role focused on modernizing a legacy healthcare workflow application while preserving graceful degradation and improving reliability for internal transplant operations.

### Handshake Description

Improved an AWS-hosted Lucee/ColdFusion healthcare workflow platform by adding anti-CSRF protection, audit logging, access-denied/404 flows, HTML5 date/time picker updates, JavaScript/CSS fixes, logistics defaults, import ordering, and reliability fixes for internal clinical operations.

### Tech Stack

Healthcare software / Tech stack: Lucee, CFML / ColdFusion, AWS, HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, cfform / cfinput migration considerations, anti-CSRF tokens, audit logging, access control workflows, HTML5 date/time pickers, JavaScript fallbacks, clinical logistics workflows, data import reliability, icons and tooltips, modal/tab UI patterns, MFI recipient workflows, Matchgrid import workflows.

### Business / Problem Context

Alliance for Paired Kidney Donation works in kidney-paired donation, where internal software supports sensitive donor/recipient workflows, transplant logistics, matching operations, audit trails, and administrative coordination. The relevant platform context is a healthcare/clinical workflow system where reliability, secure data entry, access control, and operational usability matter because small workflow failures can disrupt transplant-support processes.

### Problem / Company Impact Context

- Strengthened security and auditability by applying anti-CSRF protections globally across forms and adding user IP addresses to audit-trail logging.
- Improved protected workflow handling by sending unauthorized users to an access-denied page instead of ending sessions and by adding a clearer 404 page for nonexistent templates.
- Modernized legacy Lucee/CFML form workflows with HTML5-compliant date/time inputs, themed picker styling, JavaScript fallbacks, and cfform script updates to reduce entry friction and support graceful degradation.
- Improved internal transplant/logistics operations by adding center-level preferred blood-tube defaults and surfacing those values on logistics-sheet workflows.
- Improved import/data reliability by fixing Matchgrid ordering, MFI upload file paths, and RecipientMFIEdit crashes caused by duplicate MFI values for the same antigen.

### Work Performed

- Worked on an AWS-hosted Lucee/CFML/ColdFusion healthcare workflow platform.
- Added anti-CSRF tokens to all forms globally.
- Added user IP address capture to audit-trail logging.
- Added access-denied behavior so unauthorized access routed to a protected page instead of ending user sessions.
- Added cleaner 404 page behavior for nonexistent templates.
- Changed time, date, and date-time fields to HTML5 pickers.
- Ensured date picker inputs used standard HTML input tags instead of cfinput.
- Added JavaScript form script source to cfform in PopInForm_Offer.
- Added themed CSS so date pickers matched the rest of the application.
- Reviewed ColdFusion code for HTML5 compatibility.
- Preserved manual input and graceful degradation for date/time fields.
- Replaced text in MatchRunView tables with appropriate icons and mouseovers/tooltips.
- Tabified registrations, offers, and combinations.
- Migrated modals into separate files.
- Ensured Matchgrid import files were listed by upload date, latest first.
- Fixed MFIUpload_Recipient_Processing.cfm file location.
- Fixed RecipientMFIEdit crashes when a recipient had multiple MFI values in one dataset for the same antigen.
- Added preferred blood-tube defaults for centers.
- Added logistics sheet display/population for preferred blood tubes.
