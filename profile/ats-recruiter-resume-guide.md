# ATS and Recruiter Resume Guide

Use this guide when tailoring resumes for applicant tracking systems, recruiter screens, and hiring-manager review. These rules are grounded in career-center guidance from Yale OCS, MIT CAPD, and the University of Michigan Career Center.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Truth first: every keyword, tool, metric, and claim must be grounded in `experience-master.md`, `projects-master.md`, `skills-master.md`, or a verified repository/source.
- One page for the standard software resume unless Aryan explicitly approves a longer specialized version.
- Use the repository's established one-page application layout: 11-point body text, narrow but fixed canonical borders, single-column text, standard headings, raised 10-point solid bullet markers, and a visible 2-point gap between section headings and divider rules. Use the extra page area for stronger verified evidence; do not create one-off geometry or font changes for a particular application.
- Use the canonical LaTeX source structure required by the validator: `letterpaper,11pt` article class, explicit `letterpaper` geometry, `glyphtounicode`, `\pdfgentounicode=1`, `\pagestyle{empty}`, `\linespread{0.92}`, and the canonical single-level `tightitemize` list.
- Tailor every resume to the job description instead of using a generic all-purpose resume.
- Use a clean, consistent, ATS-readable layout with conventional section names: `Education`, `Experience`, `Projects`, and `Technical Skills`.
- Submit a text-based PDF by default when accepted, use DOCX when the employer asks for it or a portal fails PDF parsing, and never submit scanned/image-based/design-flattened resumes. Keep `resume.pdf` under the conservative 2.5 MB parser target.
- Use bullets, not paragraphs, for experience and project descriptions.
- Keep formatting consistent: dates, company names, job titles, locations, and project titles should appear in the same pattern throughout.
- Do not add photos, personal demographic information, references, salary history, or unrelated details.
- Do not use hidden text, white text, transparent text, colored keyword text, or color packages to manipulate parser output. Every keyword must be visible, truthful, and useful to a human reviewer.

## Keyword Strategy

- Extract exact job-description keywords before editing: exact posted role title, languages, frameworks, cloud tools, data tools, AI/ML terms, security/auth terms, domain terms, role responsibilities, and repeated phrases.
- Match exact wording where truthful. If the posting says `AWS Lambda`, use `AWS Lambda`, not only `serverless`.
- Include the exact posted role title once in visible resume text when truthful, normally in the centered contact/title line when no Professional Summary is needed. Recruiter filters may search for job titles and other full-text keywords. Do not change Aryan's actual past job titles or add unsupported seniority/title claims.
- Put the highest-value keywords in three places when supported: skills section, experience/project bullets, and project/role stack line.
- Prefer keywords in context over keyword lists. A skill is stronger when attached to what was built, automated, secured, analyzed, or improved.
- Avoid keyword stuffing. If a tool was only lightly used or is unrelated to the role, keep it out.
- Do not claim tools from the posting that Aryan has not used. For example, do not list `Splunk` or `Datadog` unless there is verified experience.
- Separate high-value ATS keywords from low-value boilerplate. Required tools, languages, databases, frameworks, role titles, responsibilities, and domain terms belong in the resume when supported; company slogans, equal-opportunity text, generic soft skills, and broad org names usually belong only in `tailoring-notes.md`.

## Professional Summary Rules

Omit the professional summary by default for early-career software resumes when the Experience and Technical Skills sections already make the fit clear. Use a professional summary only when it helps a recruiter understand the target fit faster than the experience section alone, such as roles where Aryan's background crosses several connected areas.

Rules:

- Keep it to two sentences maximum and no more than two rendered PDF lines total. If `pdftotext` extracts the summary as three visual lines, it fails and must be shortened or removed.
- Keep the language concise enough for a 30-60 second recruiter scan; do not write a paragraph or stack unrelated clauses.
- Write it as a value proposition, not an objective. Avoid `seeking a role where...`.
- Tailor it to the job description using truthful role keywords.
- If a summary is used, it may start with a truthful Target Professional Title Clause, but avoid awkward `-aligned` or `aligned with <role> responsibilities` phrasing. If the summary is omitted, place the concise truthful title once in the contact/title line instead.
- Include the target angle, strongest technical domains, and one clear value theme.
- Avoid generic traits such as `passionate`, `hard-working`, `fast learner`, or `team player` unless the line proves them through concrete context.
- Do not repeat the Technical Skills section as a sentence. Mention only the 2-4 highest-value stack, domain, or responsibility terms from the job description that are proven by the bullets below.
- If adding the summary makes the page crowded, trim the summary before shrinking the resume font.

Default structure when a summary is truly useful:

`Software engineer with experience in <top domains/tools>, focused on <job-relevant outcome>. Background includes <2-3 strongest proof areas>.`

## Bullet Formula

Use this default structure:

There is no fixed bullet-count maximum per role or project. Bullet count should follow the amount of distinct, relevant evidence available. For early-career application resumes, the Experience section should normally contain at least 11 strong bullets before project bullets consume meaningful space; fewer requires an `Experience Bullet Count Waiver` in `tailoring-notes.md`. Do not shorten a strong role to an arbitrary maximum, and do not add filler to make entries visually symmetrical. Every retained bullet must pass the contribution, context, and result audit below.

`Action verb + what was built/changed + how/technology + scope/domain + impact/result`

Strong software/data examples:

- `Automated a manual billing workflow with PySpark and AWS Glue, processing 20+ TB of insurance data for 700+ member companies.`
- `Built a full-stack health AI prototype with React, Vite, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, and Mistral AI for travel-health guidance.`
- `Secured an AWS-hosted Lucee/CFML healthcare workflow platform by implementing anti-CSRF tokens, IP-aware audit logging, and protected access-denied flows.`

Checklist for each bullet:

- Starts with a strong action verb.
- Does not start with `Responsible for`, `Helped`, `Worked on`, or `Assisted`.
- States what was built, changed, automated, analyzed, secured, validated, or improved.
- Names the actual technology used.
- Shows scope, user, system, or domain context.
- Includes a metric when verified.
- Explains impact without exaggeration.
- Does not read like a job description responsibility.
- Uses job-description keywords in context when the keyword is truthful.
- Is understandable without private ticket IDs, internal route names, private repository knowledge, or unexplained vendor/tool code names.

If a bullet cannot satisfy this checklist, rewrite it before compiling the final resume. If a metric is unavailable, use a truthful qualitative outcome such as reliability, traceability, security, standardization, reduced manual work, reproducibility, or clearer downstream workflows.

## Recruiter Scan Rules

Recruiters often scan quickly, so the resume must make relevance visible immediately.

- Put the strongest matching experience in the top half of the page.
- Keep recent technical roles prominent.
- Keep Actual Reality Technologies visible as the current internship when it helps chronology or target fit. Verified source material supports customer-portal engineering claims around Next.js/TypeScript, Firebase, project-management API integration, auth/session behavior, dashboard status logic, and Vitest-tested workflows; keep private customer/client details public-safe.
- For current/private-role work, use fewer higher-signal bullets that describe the customer/user surface, Aryan's owned engineering contribution, method, and outcome. Do not make the resume read like a list of recent tickets.
- Use bold sparingly for important technologies and metrics only.
- Make role alignment obvious from the first two bullets of each relevant job.
- Keep bullets concise enough to scan, usually one to two lines.
- Prioritize the role's must-have skills over impressive but unrelated material.

## ATS Formatting Rules

- Use a simple single-column layout for generated application resumes unless a template has already been tested.
- Avoid text boxes, images, icons, graphics, and decorative elements in the resume PDF.
- Do not use tables or LaTeX `tabular`/`tabular*` constructs for resume content, even when the PDF appears text-extractable.
- Do not use color or transparency in resume source. The canonical resume is black text only; colored or hidden keyword text creates credibility and parser risk.
- Use standard section headings and chronological ordering.
- Use normal punctuation and plain text for technologies where possible.
- Generate a PDF from LaTeX, then extract and inspect the text to confirm the content is readable in order.
- Keep `resume.pdf` under the conservative 2.5 MB parser target and keep final submission artifacts under 5 MB unless the employer explicitly permits a larger file.

## Human Readability Rules

- Use a readable font size. MIT CAPD recommends no smaller than 10pt; this repo should prefer readability over squeezing in marginal content.
- Keep the resume visually scannable in 30-60 seconds.
- Translate internal or obscure terms into public-safe product/system language. For example, an internal `magic link` should become an unauthenticated account-creation or secure sign-in flow when that is the meaningful recruiter context, and a private issue-tracker integration should be described by the workflow it enabled unless the specific tool is a target keyword.
- Keep private-source wording submitted-facing. Private repositories, PRs, branch names, tickets, and customer-specific details can inform the evidence, but the resume and cover letter should describe the system, workflow, method, and result in terms an outside reviewer can understand.
- Treat visual density as a failure mode during PDF review, but do not confuse healthy white space with an underfilled resume. A small bottom margin is acceptable; a large blank band is not. If the final text stops well above the bottom of the page, first add stronger verified role-aligned evidence, deepen a thin project bullet, or restore a relevant experience detail before considering the package complete.
- Preserve internship experience by default before project breadth. A weakly relevant internship may be compressed or omitted when it would displace substantially stronger evidence or force unreadable formatting; document that decision in `tailoring-notes.md`.
- When space is tight, compress or remove lower-priority project detail before cutting strong, verified, role-aligned experience bullets.
- Do not use aggressive negative spacing in Experience or Projects to satisfy the one-page rule. A full page should still have readable line spacing, clear section transitions, and enough breathing room for a recruiter scan.
- Prefer fewer high-signal projects over a crowded project list when each project is reduced to a dense one-line block.
- Do not compress Education into an awkward format unless Aryan approves it.
- When a resume is over one page, first tighten wording, remove repetition, and prioritize the strongest role-aligned evidence. Keep the canonical 11-point typography and geometry fixed so application resumes remain visually consistent.
- Keep enough detail in Experience and Projects for a human reviewer to understand what was built, how it worked, and why it mattered.
- Technical Skills should contain actual technologies and methods, not broad responsibilities. Put responsibilities such as troubleshooting, operational support, and data investigation into bullets where they have context.

## Software / AI / Data Resume Priorities

For software engineering roles:

- Prioritize full-stack features, APIs, debugging, testing, secure auth, production support, and maintainability.
- Include JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, React/Next.js/Angular, Node/Express, SQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB, Docker, Git, and cloud tools when relevant.

For AI engineering or applied AI roles:

- Prioritize applied AI systems, LLM/RAG workflows, prompt/evaluation work, model/API integration, retrieval, data grounding, and user-facing AI workflows.
- Show how AI improved a workflow; do not only list model names.

For data/cloud roles:

- Prioritize ETL, PySpark, AWS Glue, S3, Lambda, IAM, validation, data profiling, SQL, large-scale processing, and cross-source pipelines.
- Put scale and data-source context in bullets when verified.

For data analyst or business analyst roles:

- Prioritize SQL, Python, data profiling, source-system investigation, repeatable analysis, data-quality checks, reporting-ready outputs, documentation, stakeholder questions, business-process context, and measurable operational impact.
- Translate engineering-heavy work into business-readable outcomes: what question was answered, what workflow improved, what data became more trustworthy, and who could act on it.
- Do not over-index on low-level infrastructure details unless the posting asks for them.

For product analyst, operations analyst, or adjacent technical roles:

- Prioritize internal tooling, workflow mapping, requirements clarification, metrics, dashboards or dashboard-ready datasets, process automation, user pain points, cross-functional handoff, and recommendations grounded in data.
- Use project evidence only when it shows a real user/problem, decision process, or operational result.

For healthcare or compliance-adjacent roles:

- Prioritize secure workflows, audit logging, access control, data-entry reliability, operational reliability, and healthcare-adjacent project work.
- Avoid formal compliance claims unless explicitly verified.

## Work Authorization And Referral Rules

- Do not mention F-1, OPT, STEM OPT, visa status, future sponsorship, E-Verify, Form I-983, or work-authorization risk in submitted resume text unless Aryan explicitly asks.
- If a posting is silent or ambiguous about sponsorship, proceed with truthful materials and record follow-up questions internally.
- If a posting explicitly blocks sponsorship, requires independent permanent work authorization or authorization to work for any employer, limits eligibility to U.S. citizens/permanent residents, or requires incompatible clearance, treat it as an internal blocker before final submission.
- Track referral status for every application package so cold applications are not the default final state.

## Tailoring Workflow

1. Save the job description in `application-packages/<Company>/<Role>/job-description.md`.
2. Extract keywords and role responsibilities.
3. Select a primary resume angle from `resume-targeting-guide.md` and `profile/evidence-index.md`.
4. Decide whether a professional summary is useful for this specific role; omit it when it duplicates visible experience/skills.
5. Choose the strongest experience bullets first from `profile/evidence-index.md`, preserving internship roles by default; open full master files only for exact wording, source verification, or uncovered gaps. Then choose as many matching projects as the one-page layout can support without reducing experience quality.
6. Rewrite bullets using the formula above, keeping claims grounded in source docs.
7. Tune the skills section to the job's language.
8. Audit every experience and project bullet against the bullet checklist.
9. Compile LaTeX and confirm the PDF is exactly one page.
10. Confirm the PDF is text-based, under the 2.5 MB parser target, and extractable with `pdftotext`.
11. Extract PDF text and verify ATS readability.
12. Run `python3 automation/analyze_application_keywords.py application-packages/<Company>/<Role>` and use the report for exact-term alignment review.
13. Visually inspect the PDF for human readability, canonical visual consistency, and bottom-page usage before considering it done.
14. Save `tailoring-notes.md` with keywords used, experience emphasized, bullet audit notes, the human recruiter readability gate, the visual consistency gate, the page utilization gate, the submitted-facing terminology sync, score consistency, and verification results.

## Common Failure Modes

- Generic resume that does not reflect the job description.
- Unsupported keywords added only to satisfy ATS matching.
- Bullets that list tasks without impact.
- Dense bullets that hide the main technology or result.
- Underfilled one-page resumes where the bottom portion is visibly unused even though verified role-aligned evidence is available.
- Summary sections that consume space without adding role alignment.
- Awkward title-keyword phrasing such as `<Role>-aligned software engineer` when a concise title in the header would be cleaner.
- Internal ticket/tool language that makes a bullet technically true but hard for an outside reviewer to understand.
- Score breakdowns that do not add up to the recorded Job Alignment & Evidence Score.
- Skills sections that contain responsibilities instead of supported technologies.
- Too many unrelated skills, making the target role unclear.
- Project duplication or stale project claims that are no longer repository-grounded.
- Overstated AI claims that say `built AI` without explaining the product workflow, data flow, or user value.
- Validator rules that force a fixed employer/project mix instead of allowing the job-description evidence map to decide what belongs on the page.

## Source Notes

- Yale Office of Career Strategy recommends comparing resumes against a job description, checking ATS visibility, and using specific keywords to improve noticeability.
- Yale OCS states its resume templates are formatted to work with Applicant Tracking Systems.
- Greenhouse support documentation identifies resume formatting issues that can break parsing, including graphics, photos, word art, image-based resumes, complex tables, headers, footers, text boxes, columned layouts, unclear sections, and incomplete job titles.
- Greenhouse support documents a 2.5 MB parsing limit even though candidate uploads can be larger; the pipeline therefore keeps the resume parser target below 2.5 MB.
- Lever Help Center says parsing extracts readable information and cannot parse image files; it recommends testing whether document text can be highlighted.
- Workday Resume REST API documentation supports DOCX and text-based PDFs for resume scanning and specifically excludes image-based PDFs.
- Oracle Taleo, SAP SuccessFactors, and iCIMS documentation reinforce that recruiting systems store and process resume/attachment files through supported document formats rather than arbitrary visual layouts.
- NACE Job Outlook 2026 guidance says employers want evidence of skills on resumes, not only listed skills; internship experience remains especially valuable in early-career screening.
- University of Pennsylvania Career Services recommends simple ATS-compatible formatting, one-page resumes for undergraduates/recent graduates, objective measurable skills in skills sections, and soft skills illustrated through experience descriptions.
- UC Berkeley Career Engagement recommends a simple one-page format for students and standard ATS-friendly formatting with standard fonts/headings, clear work-history structure, and no headers, footers, text boxes, tables, colors, pictures, or graphics.
- MIT CAPD recommends using the position description to decide what to include, targeting each resume to the employer/position, using consistent standard formatting, strong action verbs, specific technologies, accomplishments, and quantified impact where possible.
- MIT CAPD notes employers may use keyword scanning and recommends using relevant industry/position keywords.
- University of Michigan Career Center lists a resume summary as optional and more common with experienced professionals, but available to students when useful.
- University of Michigan Career Center recommends tailoring resumes, keeping formatting easy to skim, using bullets, quantifying when possible, and using the formula `Action Verb + What + How/Why/Impact`.
- University of Michigan also recommends using AI carefully: useful for keyword extraction and review, but final bullets must be accurate and written in Aryan's own voice.

## Standards Audit Notes

- Aug. 21, 2026 web check: Reconfirmed Greenhouse, Workday, Oracle Taleo, iCIMS, MIT CAPD, UC Berkeley, University of Michigan, Yale, and Harvard guidance. Pipeline changes added the 2.5 MB resume parser target, explicit text-based PDF/DOCX handling, hidden/color-text bans, and removal of fixed-company validator markers that could weaken job-specific tailoring.
