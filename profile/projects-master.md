Built an installable Node.js CLI with `pdf-lib` that validates input files and split bounds, divides a PDF at a requested page, preserves the source path and filename, and creates two clearly named page-range outputs with actionable error handling.

#### Features

- Globally installable `pdfsplit` binary declared through `package.json`.
- PDF loading, page copying, document creation, and serialization using `pdf-lib`.
- Validation for missing arguments, non-integer or negative pages, absent files, non-PDF extensions, and out-of-range split points.
- Automatic output naming such as `report-1-3.pdf` and `report-4-10.pdf`.
- Error handling with human-readable CLI messages and nonzero process exit codes.

#### Tech Stack

Developer tooling / Tech stack: JavaScript, Node.js, CommonJS, pdf-lib, filesystem APIs, path APIs, CLI argument parsing, binary file processing, npm package binaries.

### Career Ops: Application and Job-Discovery Automation System

Date: 2025--2026

Primary positioning: workflow automation, Python CLI tooling, ATS integrations, document generation and validation, structured career data

Source: https://github.com/aryanmiriyala/career-ops

#### Platform-Ready Description

Built a repository-centered career operations system that separates job discovery from application-package generation. A dependency-light Python CLI generates targeted ATS search queries, fetches structured postings from configured Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, and SmartRecruiters endpoints, supplements them with public job-board APIs, discovers and validates ATS board identifiers, scores and filters early-career roles, maintains a minimal CSV inbox, and writes dated Markdown reports. A second agent-assisted workflow stores verified career source material, creates role-specific LaTeX resumes and cover letters, tracks applications, and validates required artifacts, one-page PDF output, text extraction, alignment notes, and build-artifact cleanup while keeping human approval boundaries explicit.

#### Handshake Description

Built a Python career-operations system with structured Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby/SmartRecruiters ingestion, role filtering, CSV/Markdown reporting, agent-assisted LaTeX application packages, PDF text/page validation, and repository-based application tracking.

#### Features

- Explicit separation between broad job discovery and selected-role application generation.
- Config-driven role buckets, source catalogs, ATS adapters, location/experience filters, and company watchlists.
- Structured direct ATS ingestion for Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, and SmartRecruiters.
- Public-job-board supplements from Arbeitnow and RemoteOK.
- ATS URL/token discovery and verification from collected search-result links.
- Strict CSV inbox containing company, position, posted date, pull date, and URL, with noisy scoring details moved to dated reports.
- Freshness tracking based on first discovery when providers omit reliable posting timestamps.
- Role-fit scoring, strict shortlist and broader review-candidate outputs, and manual application approval.
- Source-of-truth profile documents for experience, projects, skills, bullet banks, and writing guidance.
- Agent-assisted targeted LaTeX resume/cover-letter generation with job keyword maps, truthful alignment notes, and application tracking.
- Package validator checking required files, cover-letter artifacts, recorded alignment results, one-page resume PDFs, extractable text, and leftover LaTeX build artifacts.

#### Tech Stack

Workflow automation / Tech stack: Python 3, standard-library HTTP/JSON/CSV processing, CLI argument parsing, Greenhouse API, Lever API, Ashby API, SmartRecruiters API, Arbeitnow API, RemoteOK API, JSON configuration, CSV, Markdown, LaTeX, pdflatex, pdfinfo, pdftotext, Git, repository-based workflows.

Source: https://github.com/aryanmiriyala/aryanmiriyala

#### Platform-Ready Description

Built a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow and Node.js generator that refreshes featured-project metadata in a profile README. The script reads a JSON project configuration, queries the GitHub REST API for repository language, star count, links, and activity timestamps, gracefully falls back to configured names and URLs when repositories are unavailable, generates Markdown cards, replaces only a marker-delimited README section, and commits changes only when the generated output differs.

#### Handshake Description

Built a scheduled GitHub Actions and Node.js workflow that queries repository metadata, generates featured-project Markdown, safely replaces marker-delimited README content, falls back for unavailable repositories, and commits only when output changes.

#### Features

- Weekly cron schedule plus manual workflow dispatch.
- GitHub REST API client with authenticated headers, explicit errors, and optional 404 fallback behavior.
- JSON-driven featured-project configuration.
- Generated language, star-count, repository-link, and last-updated metadata.

- Integrated GitHub REST API data for repository language, stars, links, and activity timestamps through a JSON-configured generation pipeline.

## Repository Audit: Not Yet Resume-Ready

Keep these repositories in the inventory so future work can be recognized, but do not use them as authored project evidence until substantive implementation or contribution history exists.

- `Damn-Vulnerable-RESTaurant-API-Game`: a clone/template of an upstream FastAPI/PostgreSQL security-training application. The audited code and authorship metadata belong to the upstream project; no Aryan-authored modification was verified. It may support a learning narrative only if Aryan documents vulnerabilities completed, fixes implemented, or a separate write-up.
- `SolarSystemSim`: contains only a one-line README describing an intended solar-system simulation; no implementation was present in the local clone.
- `FalconGames`: public repository with a collaborative browser-game description but no committed source code.
- `beach-game`: public repository with a Three.js learning description but no committed source code.
- `clinker`: fork of the upstream gene-cluster comparison project. Do not claim the upstream implementation; add only if Aryan's own commits or contributions are identified.
- `FindYourFlame` roadmap features: matching algorithms, realtime chat, AI icebreakers, moderation, and production data models are planned, not implemented.
- `AI Project Management Tool` roadmap features: external AI generation, repository ingestion, PostgreSQL/Drizzle persistence, authentication, background jobs, and production observability are planned, not implemented.
